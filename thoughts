# Towers of Perdition

- Procedural map generation
- Classes: Warrior, Mage, ...?
- Alignment: Good-Neutral-Evil (bonuses for each?)
- Hex-based map, use maze generator (add rooms?)
- MOBs, items, drops, traps, etc

First steps:
- game setup screen
	- only need one (public, public-with-password, private)
	- for now, up to 4 players, no spectators
	- character setup when joining, can change while in game
	- ready/not ready
	- 10 sec countdown when all ready
- no more multi-resolution stuff (revert to all ~mdpi)
- remove zoom
- game doesn't scale with window --> sorry people with small monitors, but it needs to be this way
- ui has linear filters

MVP:
- up to 4 people can join
- 2 classes (warrior, mage)
- basic map generator
- 1 enemy type
